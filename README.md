Plotly graph objects and Plotly express libraries to plot different types of charts

# Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Use plotly graph objects and plotly express libraries to plot different types of charts

2. Create interesting visualizations on Airline Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset

# Plotly Libraries

plotly.graph_objects: This is a low level interface to figures, traces and layout. The Plotly graph objects module provides an automatically generated hierarchy of classes ( figures, traces, and layout) called graph objects. These graph objects represent figures with a top-level class plotly.graph_objects.Figure.

plotly.express: Plotly express is a high-level wrapper for Plotly. It is a recommended starting point for creating the most common figures provided by Plotly using a simpler syntax. It uses graph objects internally. Now let us use these libraries to plot some charts We will start with plotly_graph_objects to plot line and scatter plots

Note: You can hover the mouse over the charts whenever you want to view any statistics in the visualization charts
